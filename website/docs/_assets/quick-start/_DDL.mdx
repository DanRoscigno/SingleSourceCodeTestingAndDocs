### Create a database

Type these two lines in at the `StarRocks > ` prompt and press enter after each:

```sql reference title="Create a database"
https://github.com/DanRoscigno/SingleSourceCodeTestingAndDocs/blob/f11fcd0f1e80526c09fa838c0fa31c315bc0598c/ci/SQL/quickstart/basic/quickstart_DB.sql#L1-L3
```

### Create two tables

#### Crashdata

The crash dataset contains many more fields than these, the schema has been trimmed
down to include only the fields that might be useful to answer questions about the
impact weather has on driving conditions.

```sql reference title="Crash data DDL"
https://github.com/DanRoscigno/SingleSourceCodeTestingAndDocs/blob/385d2ce4e8d1c54bf62c44a517139621842db0bc/ci/SQL/quickstart/basic/NYPD_table.sql#L1-L16
```

#### Weatherdata

Similar to the crash data, the weather dataset has many more columns (a total of
125 columns) and only the ones that are expected to answer the questions are
included in the database.

```sql reference title="Weather data DDL"
https://github.com/DanRoscigno/SingleSourceCodeTestingAndDocs/blob/385d2ce4e8d1c54bf62c44a517139621842db0bc/ci/SQL/quickstart/basic/Weather_table.sql#L1-L17
```
